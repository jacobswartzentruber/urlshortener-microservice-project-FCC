# [URL Shortener Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/url-shortener-microservice)

This is a URL shortener microservices project for Free Code Camp Backend Development Course.

The base code is from the URL Shortener Microservice Boilerplate linked above. I added the routing necessary to complete the user stories for the challenge. I also added a few tweaks to the landing page content and styling.
